flexible
need to find overlaps, points of synergy
public-private partnerships
wouldn't have expected the # of companies in the space, 10 years ago
need to figure out what is apporpriate for govt, what for private
synergies
need to get better at partnerships

big focus on leveraging missions, reducing costs

need to be flexible
learning and moving forward
we get disconnected when we focus on the how, or the who
less thean productive if we focus that way

needs to be 'all hands on deck'
universities, companies, nasa, govt agencies, international partners
using the bets minds, the best ideas, wherever they are -- to meet the goal
rather than focus on the who and how

we get excited about the challenge -- but also need to focus on the benefit to society as a whole
we need to turn these challenges back into real things that can show real benefit to folks
(this is the nasa administrator)

closed-loop life support system will be useful to us on earth
water prufication for people in africa
this will provide benefits to people here
this is the fellow with the moustache -- nasa admin -- from the first panel on the first day
interview him

as scientists we're focused on challenge side, but we need to talk about benefits to people
need to do better with this (NASA -- big idea)

38 technologies are listed in the report

-- need to see movie from first night of the conference
-- Passage to Mars -- documentary

we know where the bodies of water are
there used to be water -- where is it today

'the one thing we know for sure is that intelligent life will be on mars once we land'

electrolosys
oxygen, hydrogen
combine hydrogen with co2
create more water, and methane

'mars will force us to get real-world solutions to these life-sustability problems which will have benefits to people on earth' 

what about coordinatoin with china?
nasa is prohibited by law from working with china in a bilateral 
can work in multilateral mode
want to work within constraints they have
-- this is an opportunity for skyline, inc

nasa publishes standards
if you build to this standard
stnadards in terms of bus architecture, power, etc
voluntary standards, not mandatory standards
really powerful way to stay out of political issues -- just offer these open standards  

just like spectrum came out
interoperability

as you want to bring a big community together, you publish open standards to help bring people together
-- opportunity for skyline -- work on the 'shipping container' standard for food that all people can build for
-- shipping conatiner idea!!

we ask the national academies, convene the experts in a field, and ask for recommendations
we avoid being driven by the partcular expertise of the people suddenly in the job, who tend to have narrow expertise
-- this is something we should do in food -- follow the nasa model for convening expertise
-- the real focus is on convening the advice and reocmmendations -- we need to lead this approach in food for space / changed climate

need to avoid programs becoming far too narrow
we find exciting science in areas that we would never have guessed

Fourth Planet Logistics -- developing lava tube ideas

Q: nike, adidas, north face -- want to develop realationship with efforts to get to mars
big companies
want to develop shoes, gear, clothing
what's available?
a: NASA can get into pretty creative agreements
if a company sees some component of a mission that they think they can tackle,
can provide unsolicited proposal
how they want to team on this
very very open to do whole variety of things with comapnies that aren't in aerospace world today
example: 3d printed habitat challenge
partnereing with caterpeillar, bechtel, bradley university
they get prize money -- this is the 'challenges' program
(what if skyline provides 

nasa space technology website -- for each technology, there are people who represent them
contact them -- they will be the best person to talk to about submitting a proprosal / better formulate what you're trying to do
-- really big thing!
-- what if we were to set up some challenge ourselves
-- work with wide variety of partners
-- work on shipping containers, food production ideas
-- focused on application to earth (a big public win for NASA, to show applications to earth-based problems)
-- we could offer a challenge that asks people to find these overlaps, demonstrate technologies
-- this is our hackathon!!
-- no cost to offer a hackathon, puts us in the right space 
-- we don't have to have a particular technology -- we can be convening

--------

strategic principles for sustainble exploration -- in the report
fiscal realism
continuity of human spaceflight
architectural openness and resilience
gradual buildup of capability

'once we get there, that's no longer the way we would have done it'
need to make key choices about the things that are right in front of us
but understand that the technologies will evolve

move towards mars is in phases 
-- check out these phases

want to move into cis-lunar space

phase 1
build up a deep space gateway
want confidence that we can develop autonomous operations in space

phase 2
deep space transport

phase 3 and 4
sustained crew expeditions


what infrastructure do we need to put in place that allow other partners to engage with us on this journey?
-- this is where 'shipping container standard' could be a big deal

NASA TRANSITION AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2017

-- to expand permanent human presence beyond low-earth orbit


Deep space gatewy
used as a proving ground
move the gateway around the lunar system
:waround the lagrange points
enable mars mission, and enable other missions

-- key point -- this is a growing presence in space, not just mars

Deep Space Gateway
'open trade'

Deep Spaace Transport
shakedown cruise
year-long cruise mission in cis-lunar space
can send crew to mars after

putting together commercial partners and international partenrs
which players want to do which things
-- this is a key time to set up these partnerships

they are not aiming for a one-shot mission to plant a flag
needs to be sustainable
building up a presence over time
almost like an antarctica research station mode
ultimately, building to a permanet human presence on mars
-- key point
-- big focus on sustainability in all of this
-- they are trying to set up for the long term


------
second panel

emirati
focused on sustained human presence on mars


-- we can already point to partners that are working on these tihngs
-- UAE space initative already blessed by this conference
indian space organization's mom mission

new initiatives that make the work exciting from an international perspective
israel's MOM orbiter

-- imfs pitch: focused on food security for astronaut missions to make them more sustainable; and overlap with technology developments for food security on this planet
-- cooling technologies, etc,

highway to mars is opening up -- highway is going to be packed

UAE hope mission  

science missions are now being executed by many companies now:w

UAE:

in the UAE we believe that we are on the cusp of a new age of space exploration that affects every human on earth
in order for us to move into the future, space exploration is the next step, esp. for folks in the uae
our goal is simply to collaborate and to contribute to humanity's efforts in the cosmos
program director of mars 2117 program
our vision is quite simple: we want to enable the UAE to contribut to humanity's interplanetary endeavors
to establish a lasting colony on mars by 2117 with international collaborations
the pillaras of the program:
research and development
education
colalboration
enable the youth to play an active role in enhancing global efforts
-- soil moisture / radiation monitoring / coqui -- youth-focused -- farm
build effective and lasting internation partnerships

unifying efforts:
orchestrator
activist
supporter
leaders of niche programs that have not been explored yet

but why are you doing this?
uae: we live in a rough neighborhood
100 million youth with 35% unemployment
two paths:  create a negative or a positive impact
want to show region, and youth, that if we contribute to science's efforts, can be at forefront of science and technology
-- so: need to connect with raman @ gsd:  same sort of inspirational efforts, design, farming, technology, overlap with space

Japanese exploration scenario with international cooperation
-- note: nothing in japanese plan about food

-- could look at packaging for all sorts of environments, from all sorts of companies around world -- look at overlaps
-- what if the hackathon included teams from food companies all around the world??

ExoMars mission

-- what if we coordinate across UAE, Japan, India, ESA, Israel, China, other space agencies around food logistics
-- companies from each country

-- overlap with explorers program at media lab

ThalesAlenia -- Italian company -- program lead
combines partners from:
france, germany, UK, others

-- we can, with our connections, solicit teams around this -- make a NASA proposal
-- looks good for them -- contributes to sustainability -- they want the visibility -- the excitement around a Mars challenge -- and they can become part of a consortium -- ongoing -- collaboaration among universities -- they can then contribute some $ to this consortium / to IMFS -- so we do the hackathon as a kickoff
-- what if we propose this initial 'seed project' to NASA -- a hackathon -- which we then sustain by memberships from companies, consortium, sustainable
-- if fail, still had a great event -- if succeed, we are starting to buildin int'l consortium, developing contacts
-- will need organizing -- can use Media Lab -- talk to Claudia -- MIT Media Lab Space Initiative -- or, host it separately 
-- NASA would be silly not to go for this
-- various 'tracks':
- packaging / shipping container / logistics
- food processing
- food production
- food testing
- water production
-- all with the double 'food security for space and earth' mission -- finding the overlaps
-- looking at technologies that are emerging ... working with scientists on tech that has 10, 20, 30 year horizon
-- can connect the projects to 'phases' of the mars report -- developing for particular stages
-- devleoping for the space presence, cis-lunar

-- connection to Dorn, FarmHack -- the idea of 'nasa in your farm'
-- developing controlled growing env's on skyline that also contribute to the local climate change scenario -- monitoring temperature, radiation, photosythesis, dna sequencing
-- develpoing the nitrate sensor -- but field robotics
-- developing on-site in-field edge 'AI' with voice capabilities
-- we can set up a series of 'challenges' like darpa, and convene the expertise to develop these things
-- and help get these technologies support from capitalist system

japanese focus is on cheap cargo transport

-- note that satellite programs are hugely important here re: agriculture, other things
-- what about proposals with Ned -- or his contacts?

q to UAE: what is relevance of mars mission to everyday citizens
a: a lot of people don't understand why space exploration

a lot of the water filters used today in rural areas come as a direct spinoff from sapce
then you get the a-ha
once you show them the spinoffs
how today's society is based on space exploration
people start to understand
the awareness is not there yet
the first space program for the arab world
focusing on awareness is a big focus, on engagement
gradually getting the acceptance of going to mars
got lots of poisitve feedback re:
the arab world -- wants a home-grown model of space exploration
--- this is amazing


q: how has multilateral work among countries helped you in your missions?
a:

nasa really appreciates its international partners
we contribute to their missions, they contribute to ours
-- this is a big angle for IMFS -- offering a gateway to these intl collabs

human destiny: to try to always to improve, independently of target
must be mix of private and public investment to get to mars
we have to design our future

uae -- 
we sent 9 engineers to s korea, they stayed for decade, brought back knowledge
for mars mission, we're collaborating with universities
asu, boulder, berkeley
research missions that are mandated to educate, to transfer knowledge
working towards transitioning that knowledge to others that want to contribute -- to space exploration
people asking: can we join in? want to hang out and be a part of the mission
'mars is a platform of creating hope, allowing people to dream big'
'if you can get to mars, you can do anything'

q:
how will you prove that there is life on mars?
extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence
a:
spectroscopic analysis
-- possible overlap with 'decode' tech?
-- samples from ground terrain
-- how to develop database for detecting life?
-- what would overlap be with earth / organisms?
-- this is a good tech to have on this planet

project mars:
-- college and early career film and graphic art competition
sciartexchange.org
focus on kids
science integrated with art activity

STEAM-powered curriculum

going to space reaps many rewards
since mars and earth have many similarities
red planet has opportunities for improving life on earth
scientific research in space has already brought benefits 
leds, artificial limbs, highway safety tech, tang

scientists think that we could learn from agriculture on mars to help agriculture on earth
mars will help provide benefits from new technology

colonizing mars will help ensure survival of human race
give us advantages economically and politically
gain important resources
jumping off point for deeper space exploration

big emphasis on STEAM curriculum

roddenberry: 'humans have an appointment with whatever thye're going to be in the future'

janet's planet
really inspiring re: art and science

let students do experiments
simulated missions
work as a team
see careers they could have

-- here's a mode in which postcapitalist economies get demonstrated
-- collaborative

kids come with knowledge and a natural curiosity
they're not 'too young'
we have to tap into that early
set up experiences for students
open-ended opprotunities
not focused on answer, but answers, solutions
provide meaningful experiences for students
oftentimes scenarios are so contrived, kids see right through them
project this year: focused on oceans
focused on monk seals, becoming extinct, finding reasons why
led to focus on ocean patterns

-- need to have diverse streams, but work on very specific projects
-- keep coming up with ideas for programs, have them on large master list

need to lift teachers up
national teacher shortage

-- rafael's son wants to be a space farmer
-- (someone else's son wants to be a space farmer too -- who was that?)

challenger center students
industry depends on getting new students engaged

trying to bring students into the manufacturing plants, into companies
hands-on learning
-- this is another focus of imfs -- education -- international

biggest competittion in aerospace / defense is not eachother, it's amazong and google
they see google everyday, but don't see these other jobs 
need to expose the students
college students have huge debt - some companies are offering scholarships

spacecamp
challenger centers
-- places to establish this food stuff
-- courses on preservation, food preparation for space
-- odyssey of the mind
-- connect with amherst middle school program
-- first robotics

minimize the amount of computer time
survival skills outdoor
work hard and play hard -- balance in your life

struggle with being defunded in the public schools

chris hadfield
don't let life kick you into the adult you don't want to become
allow yourself to be imperfect
there's any number of engineers that could list their failures, must larger than their successes
nasa: failure is not an option
janet: maybe it should be -- that's where the learning happens
question: what would you do if you knew if you could not fail -- and go pursue that

small business panel

citizens.gov

- Jenn Gustetic -- program executive for SBIR
NASA's procurement budget -- 2 to 3 billion spent on small businesses -- on variety of different activiites
-- sounds like really good contact
- Joe Hartz -- sr professional staff, us house small business committee
focus on NASA's supply chain -- hearing
small businesses play a pivotal role in NASA's supply chain
you think about NASA, you think about cape canaveral
but really NASA connects deep into the country
- Pierce Lehr (boeing; supplier management space exploration division)
NASA's procurement budget -- 2 to 3 billion spent on small businesses -- on variety of different activiites
small businesses keep us out of trouble
small buisness is a common thread throughout all of space flight
one of the most intergral parts
268 small business partnerships
small businesses partnered with prime contractors bring adapatibilty and flexibility
boeing is looking to partner with small businesses
-- this is a key angle

q: is there a chance to get on the team to build hardware -- sls, orion, habitat

a: keep selling yourself
a man made hooks, wanted to get dod contracts
joe hartz got him in touch with people
couldn't catch a break, for months
he persisted, got on a gsa contract for his hooks, got his foot in the door 
sell your technology, sell your ideas, sell your business
be as ferocious as you can

a: there are number of ways of getting involved -
many examples of businesses working on Orion, SLS
phase 2 awards, subsequent phase 3 contracts
many of those relationships come out of participating in current contracts
if you're an SBIR, then you get known
get to know their contracting office representatives 
those folks sit on other projects, you get connected to other opps
project managers are aware of companies and technologies -- 
-- could one role for IMFS be to on-ramp companies into the space ecosystem?
-- how could we develop such good contacts

q: how do small businesses get noticed?

a: understand your own capabilities
what can you bring to the table
looking to compete on / win business on these capabiitlies
explain how your capabilities intersect with architecture to make a better product
doing your homework
learn more about our needs, NASA's needs, what you can fulfill
how do you compete against other peers in the market
helps narrow the discussion to what a small business has to offer
'major prime' contractors like Boeing
Boeing has a standard supplier gateway
access to forms, become registered within the supply database
get registered before you have the discussion
say you are eager to support particular businesses 

q: for small businesses business flow is key. how can small businesses be protected from uncertainty?

a: current political environment is really tough.   
small businesses need to be active participants
call local member of congress
schedule meeting
be loud, vocal, persistent

q: 

a: 3-5 years when do we need something for this project?
questions for customers
growing base of customers for SBIR asks
some topics are written for a particular nasa need
a nimble and agile company would be a better 
there are some topics that you could 'drive a bus through'
what would you use the ISS for?
things that could be demonstrated on the ISS
additive manufacturing
general applications on the ISS
-- idea: how to preserve foods that are being grown on the ISS
so for some things, you can just propose things -- 'what to do on the ISS'

a: we would like to see people taking more risk.  smaller businesses can deliver options faster, without the bureaucracy. 
would like to get acquisitions officers more in tune with r&d
-- so they're looking for development that is done in this higher-risk category

a:  know your primary technical monitor, your assigned person, develop a relationship with them
maintaining and developing a good relationship is important
there are rockstar technical monitors
go and meet with people in the agency

-- New Space conference
https://newspace.spacefrontier.org/

SBIR program ... 
e.g. Moxie -- pull oxygen from atmosphere on mars
this will fly on Mars 2020
this is a TRL 2
integrated and launched on MARS
CRB / CRP
taking something from a TRL 3 to a TRL 6
-- this is the lingo

phase 3 erx or something
get funding on end of phase 2

space technology enterprise
thinking about pipeline
moving projects through to applications
tipping point solicitations
announcements of collaborative opprotunity
use of nasa facilities, time
-- use of johnson space center food center?
flight demonstrations
flight opportunities
testing things in microgravity
-- doing blue origin would be a great demo to secure one of these!
AES -- advanced exploratoin system
they really want SBIR involvement in every AES program

they want to promote small businesses into prime contractors, help them mature
NASA is trying to offer things that help in SBIR

q: what are big primes looking for in small businesses?

a: capabilities.
being able to deliver whatever product, good, or service
on time, on budget, up to quality
they rate suppliers on work scope
which enables primes to comply with their own contracts

innovation and creativity jump out 
need to understand work scope and how that applies to the larger system
need to be able to be flexible even within their current work scope -- switch gears mid-stream

q: 

SBIR really thinks about moving things along the TRL pipeline
at some point, need to show that there are customers and applications for the tech
ones who will put some investments, matching funds

technology transfer program for nasa
-- need to look into this program

ip concerns
phase 1 or phase 2 can one day secure IP protections

Space Policy Institute
-- check out this org, connect with them

-- food in space is a small enough area that it allows us to survey the field and not be overwhelmed

there is always a principle of competition in NASA's calls
competition across industry
there is a need to support the whole ecosystem:
- nasa
- academia
- small business
- prime contractors

need to understand your capabiitlies, what you have to offer, partnerships to complement skills
-- this is something that farmlab could do -- with comet labs -- help to arrange these partnerships among small businesses

halloway house

preplan meetings at conference

buzz aldrin

we can get to mars to stay, with a permanent human settlement
no flag and footprints this time
2039 or earlier, i beileve we will have one or two earth-mars cycles taking astronauts on a 3 month trip every 2 or four
astronauts will be transported 
single booster intercept with refueling in earth orbit

in rough terms the cost will be an order of magnitude cheaper than exploratory approach
because of the dramatically lower cost of 

cycling pathways to occupy Mars
CPOM

we will be achieving permanent occupation of mars with an international crew

we need reusability -- every element of the system
an evolutionary development
needs to be very rugged
'The Cycler'

-- this is a concept that is in the report.  need to have technologies that are sustainable, that evolve over time, that are for long term, but flexible.  agile.  what is the overlap with software development? modularity?  talk to RJ, Parker about this idea.

-- Jamie from Goddard -- working on robots that will produce needed materials on the surface of Mars 

permanent crew transportation system between earth and mars

need to use the moon to test our systems for mars
anything we use on the moon must be designed for mars
can't afford to design two different architectures
need to design one architecture

-- this is sort of akin to brent's argument for unification of analysis tech for retail warehouses -- need to have simple hardware system

need to minimize landing debris and takeoff debris

sustainable permanence through cycling pathways
reduce cost by an order of magnitude over exploratory missions

'nasa does not need to be in the business of designing and operating space habitats any more than it needs to be in the business of designing the building it occupies'
nasa needs to be an advisory tenet
not to be an architect, construction, and operations firm
we cannot afford to keep this up

these modules must be developed to be operate independently of the ISS

modules should be operating at 30 degree inclination
in order to be compatible with the launches of the Chinese
-- really interesting -- aldrin really wants to facilitate international cooperation

companies need to develop first cyclers

LEO commercial cyclers

once a month, earth-moon cycler swings past eart 3 times, swings by moon once
lunar cyclers
mars cyclers

Buzz Aldrin Insitute
-- check this out

travel to moon and mars in relative luxury
stay in luxurious 

lunar based propellants will revolutionize propellants
reusable landers
need to refuel on surface of moon

we don't want to land big tankers on the surface of the moon

enable a robust international community on the surface of the moon

ESA is eager to operate that moon village 

if we lay out an organization of a global coalition and what the plan is
we will bring China into this, and not competing with us
competition would be a poor outcome

the moon will be a training ground for the first int'l astronauts going to mars
rehearse assembly of objects

find out how boring it gets
how to deal with interruptions and frustrating situtations
by 2028/2029 they will know whether they can make a commitment to land and stay at mars

moon complex will serve as a training place
this is all focused on the moon.

the first mars occupants will be born around the year 2000


earth-mars cycler
we can send a very early verison to an asteroid
robot gets there two days before the crew
an achievement that can be demonstrated

AIAA astronautics workshop
-- later this summer -- follow up on this

outbound and inbound cycler every sinotic cycle

S1 L1 Mars to earth

not landers, but CABS
-- what's a CAB?

include triple redundancy of cabs and landers
can lose a booster and still get three cabs

if don't make it mars, can divert on swing-by to end up at earth

big impact on architecture to achieve this

everything we do on the moon is in support of mars

--idea -- connect with museum of science -- ask ray about contact


-------
panel: mars architecture

good balance between bold and achievable

architecture
open, affordable, executable

leveraging nasa's development that have already occurred
ISS
orion

choosing oxygen and hydrogen as propellant 
because it can be harvested on mars, elsewhere

orion is the core of mars base camp

'one of the weakness of current plan is: we don't know what we're going to be doing on Mars yet. knowing would really help.'

orbital atk:

major agreed-upon slide:

earth reliant ... proving ground ... earth independent

-- note -- lots of talk about earth independence in terms of fuel, even in terms of construction -- but not food!

phase 0:  demonstrate tech and conduct research

phase 1: demonstrate cirtical systems near the moon

phase 2:  validate mars-class systems

phase 3+: journey to the mars system

long-term habitat

in phase 2 -- what does a year-long mission look like?
possibility of using year-long mission for futher science
deep-space hab / space transport
go out and visit a near-earth asteroid
gives you a one-year mission 
gives you a prelude to working with low-gravity objects

separate Boeing, Lockheed, Orbital ATK approaches

visit to Phobos surface -- scientifically interesting body -- serves as a nice as a safe haven body -- radiation shield of its own -- stable platform

Paul Wooster, at SpaceX
was at MIT
mission: making humans multiplanetary

from early exploration to a self-sustaining city on Mars

increase intersection of people who want to go to mars and people who can afford to go to mars

fuel reusability
refilling in orbit
propellant production on mars 
right propellant

-- no way is spacex going to solve the food problem
-- nasa neither
-- need a consortium of international food companies, massive ecocystem -- best of all the tech
-- analysis, processing, preservation, production, distribution -- all in space
-- what's the vision for this
-- could you provide packaging out of asteroid materials (or lightweight)

transfer propellant from one vehicle to another


SpaceX Archiecture Features

key insight: minimize the number of unique elements -- to limit the scope of devleopment required

reusable
low cost cargo delivery
extensive in-situ resource use on mars,
propellant production, consumables generatoin, outpost growth
pre-emplaced resources
all to enable city
-- but nothing about food!

aerojet / rocketdyne's presentation:

what are the fundamental building blocks

SLS:
evolvable SLS rocket
Space Launch System

key features:

greater mass
larger volume
higher velocity

can avoid needing to unfurl optics on satellites

Orion:
interplanetary spacecraft
take crew to multiple deep space destinations
reduandant crew systems, avionics

Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) -- efficient transfer of cargo, habits, payloads
Chemical or Nuclear Thermal Propulsion (NTP) -- quickly transport astronauts to and from Mars
Transit Habitat -- provide a safe place to live and work during 6 mos journey
Mars Lander and Mars Ascent vehicles

-- what's the quick version of what we're doing
food security for mars --> food security for earth

the element masses and how you move them around have a huge impact on what you're able to do
how we deal with the affordability issue is vitally important, and drives everything
mars basecamp

big focus on human ecosystem effects
spacex focus is on driving down $/kg
mass = cost
-- so how does this interact with Buzz Aldrin's point about food

in-situ resource utilization
is a big swinger on the architecture design
-- this points to coming up with growing food in space asap
-- we need an ideation session around this
-- what's the terrestrial demonstration of growing food in space?  minus the zero g aspect?  
-- could we demo it on iSS -- packaging and preserving foods in space?
-- what about insect protein in space? how do insects fare?  what about cellular meat production in space? spaceburgers?

-------
panel: media / cinema

-- note that spacex has amazing video

media helps us make things more accessible
-- what if we make a video about nasa spinoffs that are relevant to everyday lives -- esp. developing world

fictional and factual documentation of mission tech

NASA works to help out documentaries -- 137 last year
-- would they be interested to work on documentary about food in space?

role of science fiction 
marvel 

NASA is looking for an opportunity to get people jazzed about NASA
