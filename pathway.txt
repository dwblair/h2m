Possible pathway for IMFS:

Phase 1. HK gives enough initial funding for few-month exploration of 'food security in extreme environments' idea. 

During that time, we:
- Develop contacts in relevant agencies / industries
- Make a list of possible projects / clients
- Apply for grant funding (SBIR) to build out one or more of the key ideas
- Partner with Communities in Space, other groups working broadly on space exploration and sustainability

Phase 2. 

Use focus / projects developed in phase I to start to build out IMFS projects.
- If SBIR comes in, we work hard on building that 
- If other small contracts come in, we work on those
- use additional funding (contracts, SBIR, more $ from HK) to hire new staff relevant to projects
